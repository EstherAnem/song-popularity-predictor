When an artist releases an album, we often forget about the multitudes of unreleased music that was recorded. The problem is that it is impossible for an artist to release every song they record and choosing which songs to release is a hard feat. Artists and record labels usually want to release the songs that will perform best on charts but struggle to ascertain what songs these would be. 

The project topic is “Song Popularity Prediction.” By determining the song with the most potential for popularity, the problem of choosing which songs to release can be addressed. This would be done by analyzing songs based on component features to determine probability of popularity. This could be measured in a number of ways but will be mainly based upon the Spotify popularity feature.

Spotify features, such as acousticness, danceability, etc. were analyzed, which are all provided by the Spotify API. From this analysis it would be possible to determine what mixture of features of a song make it popular or a “hit”. Some key points to cover would be the different correlations between each feature and how each will impact the potential Spotify popularity.
